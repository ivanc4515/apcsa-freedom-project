## Context
The “Freedom Project” for APCSA is all about creating something using a tool you learned on your own. The purpose of this blog is to document my journy in creating my projest using [Unity](https://unity.com/). 

## Content
For my project, I am making a 3D platformer game. This blog will walk through my process of independently studying the Unity engine in order to make platformer. It shows my learning process and the improvements I made along the way.
