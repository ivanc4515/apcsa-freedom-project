This tool is a very popular tool used by many programmers to create games. Some notable games like Cuphead, Hearthstone, Hollow Knight, and Crossy Road are games that were made using this engine. With this diverse set of games, you can tell that Unity is very flexible and can create many things. It is capable of creating 3D or 2D games using its physics engine. 

For my project, I plan on creating an open-world 3D platformer game. In this game, I plan on creating a set of puzzles the payer has to navigate to progress. I have started to learn how to now use Unity by downloading their demos/tutorial templates. There I was able to learn some of the basics of navigating the tool. I did the tutorial for both 3D and 2D games and found that the 3D one would best suit my idea.
