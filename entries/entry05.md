Since the main mechanics of the game has been created, the final step of the game was to create a map for the player to progress through. Level design on Unity can be simple but also limited at the same time. It allows me to add objects to the world easily due to the UI. The objects I used are basic 3-dimensional shapes and work for the purposes of the MVP.  One thing that wasn't so desirable though was that they were hard to manipulate and change to make for interesting terrain. I looked at some of the documentation in the (Unity's Documentation)[] to see if there was any way to create more advanced shapes on their program. Though I couldn't find anything in the documentation, there was another thing I tried. Unity has its own (Asset Store)[] that allows creators and graphic designers to post their work. Some are free but the majority of the packs require money to buy. 

Since I was limited to the base shapes I created simple platforms for the player to jump to. I implemented levels into the game and color-coated them to make differentiating them easy. Another thing I did was to implement the mechanics that I added into their own level. That way as you play you need to figure out what needs to be done to progress the game. Objects have their own set position, rotation, and scale. This can all be set on the inspector panel. There the panel show all the traits the objects contain.
