Since the main mechanics of the game has been created, the final step of the game was to create a map for the player to progress through. Level design on Unity can be simple but also limited at the same time. It allows me to add objects to the world easily due to the UI. The objects I used are basic 3-dimensional shapes and work for the purposes of the MVP.  One thing that wasn't so desirable though was that they were hard to manipulate and change to make for interesting terrain. I looked at some of the documentation in the [Unity's Documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/GameObjects.html) to see if there was any way to create more advanced shapes on their program. Though I couldn't find anything in the documentation, there was another thing I tried. Unity has its own [Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com) that allows creators and graphic designers to post their work. Some are free but the majority of the packs require money to buy. 

Since I was limited to the base shapes I created simple platforms for the player to jump to. I implemented levels into the game and color-coated them to make differentiating them easy. Another thing I did was to implement the mechanics that I added into their own level. That way as you play you need to figure out what needs to be done to progress the game. Objects have their own set position, rotation, and scale. This can all be set on the inspector panel. There the panel show all the traits the objects contain.

My Engineering Design Process is at 7(Improve). My MVP is done and all I can do now is to improve upon what I already built. The next things I can do are add more levels or character mechanics. This is probably going to be the priority because I only have 2 levels to play as of right now. Alternatively, I can also try to add texture to some of the objects to make the world look nicer. 

The skills I learned were Organization and Creativity. As seen in the previous image, the Hierarchy panel shows all the objects in the world. This can fill up the panel quickly and it's important to sort the objects using proper names and to separate them into sections. By doing this it was a lot easier to locate specific sections and edit them accordingly. The other thing I learned was Creativity since the levels were a free roam creation. When creating the lives I would need to decide where to make the next platform and to decide how difficult it would be to get there.
